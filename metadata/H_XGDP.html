MSTI indicators cover the resources devoted to research and development, patent families, technology balance of payments and international trade in R&D-intensive industries from 1981 onwards,  Indicators on R&D expenditures, budgets and personnel are derived from the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/science/inno/researchanddevelopmentstatisticsrds.htm">OECD Research and Development Statistics</a> (RDS) database, which is based on the data reported to OECD and Eurostat in the framework of the joint OECD/Eurostat international data collection on resources devoted to R&D. Data include final or provisional results as well as forecasts established by government authorities. <br> <\br> The sources for the technology payment and receipt indicators is the OECD Technological Balance of Payments (TBP) Database (internal use only). Data include final or provisional results as well as forecasts established by government authorities. <br> <\br> It also includes the MSTI economic indicators (GDP, value-added in industry, PPP, GDP deflator, total employment, total labour force) are drawn from the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/std/na/">OECD National Accounts</a> database -updated on the basis of the projections published in the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/eco/economicoutlook.htm">OECD Economic Outlook</a>- and from <a href="http://www.oecd.org/std/labour-stats/">OECD Labour Force</a> databases. <br> <\br>  For most of the non-OECD economies featured in MSTI, data are provided by other international organisations (e.g. Eurostat, the World Bank, International Labour Organisation etc.). The sources for the patent indicators is the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/science/inno/oecdpatentdatabases.htm">OECD Patent Database</a>. Data include final or provisional results as well as forecasts established by government authorities. <br> <\br>  Triadic patent families are a sub-set of patents all filed together at the European Patent Office (EPO), at the Japanese Patent Office (JPO) and granted by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), protecting the same set of inventions. Indicators based on patent families improve the international comparability and the quality of patent's indicators (overcoming the drawbacks of traditional patent-based indicators, such as the "home advantage").<br /><br /><strong>Source 2:</strong> Bi-annual.
